4. Application Description
   The weather application is built using React, enabling you to access weather data for your city.
   Upon launching the application, you'll be asked to share your location. Confirming this will lead to a
   request to OpenWeatherMap, returning weather details for your exact location.

Should you decline to share your location, the weather for Warsaw will be displayed by default.
