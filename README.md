#  Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

## 1. What's This All About?
Hey there! If you're like me and always wondering whether to grab an umbrella or put on some sunscreen, this weather app has got your back. It's made with some cool tools and can tell you the weather wherever you are.

### Tools I Used
   - **TypeScript**: Keeps things neat and error-free (mostly!).
   - **React**: For making everything look nice on your screen.
   - **RTK Query**: Grabs the weather data so you know whether to wear shorts or a sweater.
   - **Mui Materials**: Makes everything look pretty!
   - **Jest**: A robust testing framework that helps in keeping the code bug-free.

## 2. Before You Start
You're gonna need **Node.js** on your computer. If you don't have it, get it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## 3. Let's Get Rolling!
### How to Set It Up

Copy the Code: Open up your terminal and clone the repository with this line:
```
git clone https://github.com/NursultanBazargaziyev/ts-weather-app.git
```

Get into the Project Folder:
```
cd ts-weather-app/
```

Install All the Stuff We Need:
```
npm install
```

Start It Up!:
```
npm start
```

Testing It All Out
I used Jest to run tests and make sure everything's working as it should. If you're looking to contribute, you can run the tests with:
```
npm test
```
## 4. What's Inside?
This thing lets you check the weather in your city. When you open it, it'll ask if it can know where you are. Say yes, and boom, you've got your local weather. If you say no, you'll see the weather in Warsaw, 'cause why not?

### How the Data Gets to You
I used RTK Query to get the weather info. It's fast and does the job.

### Making It Look Nice
I used Mui Material to style things up. It's like putting a fresh coat of paint on everything!

Have fun with this, and if you have any questions or want to make it even cooler, feel free to hit me up or make a pull request. Happy coding! üöÄ
